# Favourite Superman Stories

* [Superman (1978)](https://www.dccomics.com/movies/superman-1978) - The classic movie starring Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. Richard Donner set out to make audiences believe that they made a man fly, and succeeded in more ways than one. It's corny, yeah, but it gets to the heart of what makes Superman great: He saves the world because he can, and because he wants to. John Williams' score is legendary for a reason, and it's hard not to associate any version of Superman with that classic theme and portrayal.
* [All-Star Superman](https://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/all-star-superman) - Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely tell a tale of Superman's last year after having been poisoned by direct exposition to the sun's radiation at close range. This is the 12 works of Hercules, if Hercules was an alien analogue of Moses, and a love letter to Superman's history, as well as a show of the superhero as the modern myth. It's strange, heroic, and inspiring. Basically everything Superman should be.
* [The Last Son of Tomorrow](http://www.tor.com/stories/2009/05/last-son-of-tomorrow) - Not directly a Superman story, but all of the classic beats are there: dying world, last hope, kind parents. This story tells spans many thousands of years, and deals with the notion of a demi-god living among people, while never losing hs own sense of being.
* [Superman: Secret Identity](https://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/superman-secret-identity-2004/superman-secret-identity) - A non-canonical tale that sees expansion of Earth Prime's Superboy, in which Clark Kent, a small kid from Picketsville, Kansas, who is teased for sharing the name and likeness of the fictional character who bears his namesake. Until one day, he wakes up levitating, and realizes he has the same powers as the comic-book Superman.
* [Kingdom Come](https://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/kingdom-come-1996/kingdom-come-new-edition) - Ten years after leaving the world of superheroics, Superman re-dons the red and blue tights as a world-ending cataclysm is about to hit the planet. The comic was mainly a criticism of 1980s and 1990s superhero comics, which saw the rise of "darker" and "edgier" characters and anti-heroes. Mark Waid's love letter to classic heroicism re-kindled my love of the character and what he can stand for.
* [Superman: Red Son](https://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/superman-red-son) - What if Superman landed in Warsaw, Poland, rather than in Smallville Kansas, at the dawn of Stalin's rise to power? Would he still be "Superman"? (spoiler alert: yes) Mark Millar's tale of a Superman who figures "Maybe I should use my god-like status to help people" progressively works its way to totalitariansm, but still manages to maintain his core values through it all. The ending twist is both clever and disappointing, but works within the context of the narrative. And isn't it interesting to have a story in which you kinda *want* to root for Lex Luthor?
* [Justice League: Gods and Monsters](https://www.dccomics.com/movies/justice-league-gods-and-monsters-2015) - An animated feature from Batman: the Animated Series writer and producer Bruce Timm, and co-producer Alan Burnett. This one features a Superman who is not only General Zod's biological son, but was also raised by Mexican refugees. While this is meant as a dark alternate universe, it still manages to keep the core spirit of Superman's kindness...up to a point. That kindness is best presented in the short ["Bomb"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYSxN4ezhO4), featuring a young, scared weapon known as Brainiac.
* [Supergirl (TV series)](http://www.cwtv.com/shows/Supergirl) - There are a few good reasons to watch Supergirl, but for now I just want to focus on Tyler Hoechlin's portrayal, which is simply the best live-action Superman in years. His humility, caring, and willingness to help are all on display within the first few minutes of appearing on the show. Something other recent live-action attempts have failed at capturing.

* [Superman: American Alien](https://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/superman-american-alien) - I would have recommended this more, if it wasn't for the [repeat accusations of abuse and manipulation levied at writer Max Landis](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bright-screenwriter-max-landis-accused-of-sexual-assault). Having seen his many videos regarding Superman, I was excited to read a story penned by him. His goal? Seven issues, focusing on seven periods of Clark Kent's life. And it did deliver. Mostly. The only reason it's listed here is that I bought it before I knew what he did. If you want to read it, borrow it from someone, or pick it up from your local library. I can't condone providing him with further monetary support.
