## {{ page.title }} - Craig Thompson

I am using this post to document the elements of Arab culture, Muslim lore, and problematic tropes found in Craig Thompson's Habibi. This will also include discussions of what it does well. Once completed, this will transform into a more complete text.

[Lo Shu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_Shu_Square) - Presented as an old Arabian tale, but actually originates in China. Bears mentioning that the presented alphabet uses the older [Abjadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet#Abjadi) order, rather than the modern [Hijaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet#Hijāʾī). Later, in chapter 3 (The Raping of Eden), the [Buduh(بدوح)](https://hypernumber.blogspot.com/2015/01/buduh-magic-square-in-islamic.html) is introduced.

## Passages from the Qur'an:
* "Will you make in the world one that will spread corruption in it and spill blood while we rice your praise and revere you?" - 2:30

* "O Father! Do as you are commanded. Allah willing, you shall find me among the steadfast." 37:102

* "He makes you n the wombs of your mothers in stages. One after another. In three veils of darkness." - 39:6

* "God produced you from the earth like a vegetable growth" 74:17

* Sura't Maryam is quoted in Arabic only (19:32)

* "If all the trees on earth were made into pens, and the ocean supplied the ink, augmented by seven more oceans, the words of god would not run out" - 31:27

First Sura 96th (al Alaq)

"Say BISMILLAH, in the name of God, as the priest does with a knife when he offers an animal. BISMILLAH your old self to find your real name" - Rumi

"Mystic tradition says there are 70,000 veils of light and darkness that separate us from our Creator. Every baby is born weeping for the soul knows its separation from ALLAH. And when a child cries in its sleep, it is the soul remembering some piece of what has been LOST."

The [Buraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buraq) is mentioned in passing, while refering to Dodola (while describing her as the "desert witch", who is made of "sand and fire").

Some passages are not in classical Arabic, but perhaps modern Arabic or Parsi. This can be seen by the use of the "پ", within
"فالنطر إلا پ‬ن مم خلق", which translates to "It is only a matter of creation". However, with a classic "ب", it becomes: "فالنطر إلا بن  مم خلق", meaning "Only the son of a man is created"

To maintain Christianity, "أيوب" (Ayub) is maintained as "Job".

A poem by Badr Shaker Sayyab (بدر شاكر السياب), likely Rain Song (انشودة المطر) is copied in Arabic only. It's relayed after Dodola tells a story of how her village would dress her up in flowers and vines, before dousing her in water while she spun like the Dervish, only to then follow with a treaty about how the earth is being destroyed, and how Dodola's body will remain a commodity.
